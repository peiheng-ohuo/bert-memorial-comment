This is a working paper.

I attempt to use Qing‑era memorials (zouzhe) and comments (zhupi) to study the emperor's decision-making patterns and autocratic power. In brief, I find that the proportion of memorials in which the emperor personally gave instructions was remarkably low. Decision-making authority for most memorials was delegated to the bureaucratic system. Moreover, this delegation of authority was highly procedural -- a point I aim to prove with deep learning methods.

I fine‑tuned GuwenBERT models to learn the relationship between memorial titles and specific comment labels. The strong performance of these models helps illustrate the procedural nature of the emperor's delegation of decision-making authority.

I will gradually upload the code and data here. The code is already available, and the manually labeled comment data will be released after the paper is published.
